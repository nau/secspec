Triple Sec is a simple security setup scheme for your digital life
that is easy to use and relatively hard to break.

Full setup guide and description is available at https://nau.github.io/triplesec/[TripleSec].

== Use a password manager
If you need to use one across multiple platforms, use https://bitwarden.com/[Bitwarden]. It's open-source, and it's free. It has all major browser extensions, a desktop app, and mobile apps for iOS and Android. That's my recommendation.

If you only use Apple devices, use their https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085[iCloud Keychain]. It https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/v1lpr0/icloud_keychain_and_firefox_autofill_on_macos/[doesn't work with Firefox] though.

https://1password.com/[1Password] is a good alternative, but it's not open-source, and it's not free.

Use https://keepass.info/[KeyPass] if you know what you're doing.

== Passwords and PINs
* Generate a random 6-digit PIN and memorize it. That's your phone passcode.
* First 4 digits of the PIN is your phisical SIM PIN. Set up your phone to ask for SIM PIN on every boot. This step is not that important for eSIM.
* Generate 3 random words using https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/[Bitwarden Password Generator] or a generator below.
* Combine with the PIN and memorize the passphrase.
That's your password manager Master Password.
* Take a word and combine it with PIN. That's your laptop password. You MAY store it in the password manager.

* Enable full disk encryption on your laptop. Enable FileVault on your Macs.
* Generate and store unique passwords using your password manager.
* Use your password manager to generate 2FA codes, they all can do it.
* Enable 2FA for all your services that support it.
* Enable Touch ID/Face ID for your password manager for convenience.
* ...
* Profit!

== Emergency access
Set up an emergency access.

* For Bitwarden: https://bitwarden.com/help/emergency-access/[Emergency Access]
* For 1Password: https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/[Emergency Kit]
* Set up a https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212513[recovery account] for iCloud Keychain.
* Or https://myaccount.google.com/inactive[Google Digital Legacy Plan]

== Don'ts

* Don't use the same password for multiple services.
* Don't store your crypto seed in your password manager.
* Don't give access to your devices to anyone you don't trust.

== Resume

Now all your services proctected with unique secure passwords and 2FA.
All your passwords are stored in a secure password manager and automatically synced across all your devices.

Your password manager is protected with a strong 60 bit entropy passphrase.
All you need to remember is your PIN and 3 random words, easy. And you have an emergency access to your password manager.
